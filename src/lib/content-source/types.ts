/**
 * ContentSource — one abstraction over where customer-authored content lives.
 *
 * The engine reads MDX pages, snippets, and content-adjacent config through
 * this interface so the same rendering pipeline works whether content is
 * embedded in the build (OSS/self-host default) or served from the deployed
 * Worker's own static assets (managed hosting, where a content publish swaps
 * assets without rebuilding the Worker).
 *
 * This is deliberately NOT a cloud-bridge service: the bridge carries paid
 * data-plane features (Track, AI answers, analytics), while content sourcing
 * is a runtime concern selected by environment. Nothing here imports
 * `src/cloud`.
 *
 * All paths are project-relative POSIX paths — the same keys used by
 * `@/lib/runtime-sources` (e.g. `src/content/introduction.mdx`,
 * `snippets/note.mdx`, `docs.json`).
