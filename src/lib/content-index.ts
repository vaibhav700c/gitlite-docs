/**
 * Runtime content index — frontmatter and enumeration without the bundle.
 *
 * Managed hosting injects `THALLY_CONTENT_INDEX` as a plain-text Worker
 * binding: one JSON object mapping every content file the release serves to
 * its parsed frontmatter and modification time. It exists so the projections
 * *about* content — navigation labels, page enumeration, sitemap, llms.txt —
 * can describe the content actually being served rather than whatever was
 * compiled into this bundle. Page bodies are not in the index; they resolve
 * through the ContentSource.
 *
 * When the binding is present it is authoritative: a page missing from the
 * index does not exist, even if the compiled bundle carries it. Falling back
 * per-page would resurrect the bundle's pages on a site whose content has
 * diverged from it, which is precisely the failure this index prevents.
 * When the binding is absent (self-hosted, filesystem builds, or any managed
 * release predating it) every reader keeps the compiled behaviour, byte for
 * byte.
 *
 * Reads happen at module scope. workerd populates `process.env` from text
 * bindings before top-level module evaluation (verified empirically; a
 * 163 KiB index parses in ~4 ms), so this is deliberately synchronous — the
 * consumers (`src/data/docs.ts`, `src/lib/runtime-sources.ts`) run during
 * module initialisation and cannot await.
 *
 * Large managed sites exceed the platform's small plain-text binding budget.
 * Request-time consumers use {@link loadContentIndex}, which preserves this
 * synchronous fast path and otherwise reads the same index from ASSETS.
